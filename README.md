## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

These are the words of a developer who works long hours:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on IT company.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 'How To Grow'
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about coding, architecture, anything boring.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Many developers are arrogant and conceited, but the layman doesn't see it that way, which is sometimes annoying and fascinating.

### We better talk about something, don't you think?
